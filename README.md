# MedievalLifeWebbServer

This is the app I will work with during the Frontend part of my course. 

This was created when I started to learn Java from the ground (it shows), now I going for becoming a "real" Java Dev and will build upon this firstly for presentation on the web (but I will try to clean it up when I have the time and opportunity).

The code itself resides in https://github.com/Hteph/MedievalLife as I want to keep this clean in order to not confuse openshit too much.

It is a app for generating a dynasty tree (for use as a background of an RPG character, or just to populate a small medival hamlet) with code for the common heritage software appended at the end. It generates a simple text file for now, first describing the living and dead members of the family and then the same info (more or less) in Gedcome code for use in heritage software.

And here is the link to the openshift app:
